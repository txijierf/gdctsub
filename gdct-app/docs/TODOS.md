# TODOS

## Prioritized

- Excel sheet mouse auto-scroll
- Adjust z-index of cells when value is present
- Excel formulas
- Menu for sheet navigations
- Hyperlinks
- Import ID
- User settings
- Phase deadlines
- Report
- Remove Save and Download from Excel reducer
- Normalize Redux store structure

## Unprioritized

- Token blacklist
- Responsiveness
- Pagination
- Miscellaneous information - ie: job positions
- General and route error handlers- should everything be handled here or do it in the original route? (General error handler handles most errors but may not make sense for some routes)
- Strengthen verfication ids (change MongoDB Id to a more secure Id -- MongoDB Id is too predicatable)
- Keep styles consistent (ie, Profile and All packages headers/pages - mismatched styles)
- It's possible that an admin updates his/her own roles - refetch data in that case (very unlikely case)

## Important but Unprioritized (may be too time-consuming at the moment - work on it gradually)

- Scope Checking
